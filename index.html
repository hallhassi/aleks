  <h1>Aleks Schillmoeller, Pilates Instructor, Yoga Teacher in the Bhakti Yoga Lineage</h1>
  <img src='bio.jpg' width='200px'>
  <p>Aleks was first introduced to Pilates at the age of 10 to complement her dance training. While always an interested student, Aleks did not begin to more heavily invest in her Pilates training until the age of 18, when she experienced a near career-ending back injury during her first year dancing professionally. Using Pilates as a tool for rehabilitation, Aleks made a full recovery and was so inspired that she decided to become a certified instructor. In 2017, Aleks received her Comprehensive Mat and Apparatus Certification from Core Chicago Pilates and has been teaching Pilates full-time ever since. She has done additional pre/post natal training through the Equinox Pilates Institute and is currently completing a bridging program to become a Stott Certified Instructor. In early 2020, Aleks completed her Yoga Teacher Certification through Pure Yoga in New York City and completed additional training in bhakti-yoga through the Bhakti Center in NYC. Aleks is very passionate about helping each body overcome its specific limitations and increase overall body awareness. Her primary interests are injury rehabilitation and prevention, improving strength and mobility, and stabilizing major joints. Before COVID-19, Aleks was professional dancer in New York City. She is currently an undergraduate student at Columbia University studying Environmental Biology and Religion with hopes of attending medical school or physical therapy school.</p>
  <p> Due to COVID-19 Aleks is teaching group classes and private lessons online. She currently works with clients on the East Coast, Midwest, West Coast, and in Hawaii. If you are interested in group classes or private lessons, please email <a href='mailto:aleks.mvmt@gmail.com'>aleks.mvmt@gmail.com</a> </p>
